            <p>For an undergraduate calculating <strong>gpa </strong> manually is a pretty boring as well as a time consuming task.eventhough there are online tools for this still there's room for improvement.So,We have came up with this idea of onestop solution for the tasks like calculating gpa,taking down notes and managing monthly expenses through a <strong>single App.</strong></p>
            <img src="img/App.jpg" alt="image of an app" class="img">
            <p>So,inside our app we are going to provide a custamizable <strong>gpa calculator,pdf viewer and an editor,To Do List </strong> as well as <strong>an expense tracker.</strong> Inside our gpa calculator we are going to provide the oppotunity to the user to input the no.of credits,no.of courses and expected gpa and in return app will provide what the grades that should be otained to reach the target.In the To Do List we allow users to make shedules and we will use a deep a learning model to analyze the habbits and make suggetions to improve the productivity.Pdf viewer and editor is one of the crucial parts of or project.This will allow users to <strong>take down the notes on the spot they need and save them in the same location mimicking the functionality of sticky notes.</strong></p>
            <p>Expense tracker is also one crucial part of this application.As an undergraduate one has to strictly mange his finances.So via this app we are trying to <strong>keep the track of one's expenditure and issue warnings if it exceeds the permited amount</strong>.Also we are going to set up an achivemnt system to set up <strong> savings goals and visualize them in graphical way</strong> so that the users would be encouraged to achieve them.As a further development we would allow users to link their bank account to this application so that they can rest while this app takes good care of user's finances.We are still in the developing phase of this application as it involves many projects.But we are hoping to deploy this aplication on the <strong>Google playstore platform</strong> as soon as we are finished.</p>
